        <p>The Beatles were an English Band who formed in Liverpool, England in 1957. They were originally called the
            "Quarrymen" and made up originally of John Lennon, Paul Mccartney, George Harrison, Pete Best, and Stuart 
            Sutcliffe. The7 performed in England from 1957-1960, before being renamed the Beatles and moving to Germany.</p>

        <p>The Beatles performed in Hamburg, British Germany from 1960 to 1962, where they learned to be good. 
            Unfortunately, they were still not complete. Stuart Sutcliffe died of a brain illness in 1962 and Pete Best
            was not doing well enough for the band.
        </p>

    <p>When the Beatles returned to England in 1962, Pete Best was fired and replaced with Ringo Starr, a drummer
        from Liverpool.
